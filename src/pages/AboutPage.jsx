            <p class="info">My name is David Santiago and I am very passionate about web development. I have always been
                a fan of tech from a
                young age. From the moment i got my first desktop computer I was addicted! I have always wanted to do
                something positive in the world,
                and I feel that with the web developing skills i have learned and will learn, I can put them to use to
                make a positive impact.
